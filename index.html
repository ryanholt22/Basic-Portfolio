            Hello! My name is Ryan Holt and I am going to tell you a little bit about myself!
             Theres a lot of things I love to do in my freetime besides computer coding.
            From sports, to computer gaming I love to be both inside and outside. Truly the best of
            both worlds!
         </p>

         <p>Well if you dont know who I am, I play both Semi-Professional, and Divsion 2 paintball.
             The paintball team I play on Plays all NXL (National X-Ball League) events which are
             hosted in 5 different locations. The locations are anywhere from icey cold Chicago, to 
             burning hot Florida. A few other locations are New Jersey, Dallas, Las Vegas.
         </p>

         <p>
            Besides being outside, working out, playing sports, and being active I also love being inside!
            When im inside you can find me practicing coding new websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            Besides that I love to play computer games on my desktop! A few of those include:
            <ol>
                <li>Escape From Tarkov.</li>
                <li>Borderlands.</li>
                <li>Counter Strike Source.</li>
                <li>BattleField.</li>
            </ol>
         </p>
